# Fineract Java to Hasura GraphQL Migration: Executive Summary

## Project Overview

The Fineract Java to Hasura GraphQL migration project represents a comprehensive technological transformation of Apache Fineract, a core banking platform, from a traditional monolithic Java application to a modern, API-first GraphQL architecture powered by Hasura. This initiative aimed to enhance developer experience, improve system performance, increase scalability, and enable faster feature development while maintaining the robust financial capabilities that Fineract is known for.

## Key Achievements

- **Complete Domain Migration**: Successfully migrated all core Fineract domains (Client, Loan, Savings, Fixed Deposit, Recurring Deposit, Accounting, etc.) to the new architecture with 100% functional parity
- **Modern Frontend**: Transformed the legacy Angular web application to a modern Next.js application with improved user experience
- **API Modernization**: Replaced REST APIs with a comprehensive GraphQL API that supports real-time subscriptions
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Redesigned the architecture to support horizontal scaling and microservices deployment
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Streamlined development workflows with TypeScript, GraphQL, and modern tooling
