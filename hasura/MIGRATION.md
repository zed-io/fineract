# Migration Status

This document tracks the migration status from the Java-based Apache Fineract to the Hasura-based implementation.

## Core Modules

| Module | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Multi-tenancy | In Progress | Schema design complete, permissions in progress |
| Authentication | In Progress | JWT implementation planned |
| Authorization | In Progress | Role-based permissions being mapped to Hasura |
| Core Domain | In Progress | Base entities designed |

## Business Modules

| Module | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Client Management | In Progress | Base schema defined |
| Group Management | In Progress | Base schema defined |
| Loan Management | In Progress | Schema designed, complex logic being mapped to Actions |
| Savings Management | Planned | Schema design in progress |
| Accounting | Planned | Complex accounting rules to be implemented in Actions |
| Reporting | Planned | To be implemented using GraphQL queries with aggregations |
| Workflow | Planned | Event-driven workflow implementation planned |

## Technical Components

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| PostgreSQL Schema | In Progress | Core entities defined |
| GraphQL Schema | In Progress | Auto-generated from DB schema with customizations |
| Hasura Actions | In Progress | Key business operations being mapped |
| Row-Level Security | In Progress | Permission rules being defined |
| Event Triggers | Planned | Core business events mapped |
| REST Compatibility | Planned | REST endpoints mapped to GraphQL |

## Migration Approach

The migration is following these steps:

1. **Schema Design**: Convert MySQL/MariaDB schema to PostgreSQL-optimized design
2. **Data Modeling**: Define relationships, constraints, and indexes
3. **Permissions**: Implement row-level security for multi-tenancy
4. **Business Logic**: Convert Java business logic to Hasura Actions
5. **Event Handlers**: Implement event triggers for reactive operations
6. **Testing**: Validate functional parity with the original system

## Challenges

- Complex loan calculation logic needs careful implementation in Actions
- Multi-tenancy security requires thorough validation
- Batch job processing requires custom implementation
- Authentication and authorization mapping to Hasura's permission system
