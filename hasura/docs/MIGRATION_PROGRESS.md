## Migration Strategy

Our migration approach is domain-driven, focusing on one domain at a time to ensure proper testing and validation before moving to the next domain. The general process for each domain is:

1. **Analysis**: Study the existing Java implementation to understand domain models, business rules, and workflows
2. **Schema Migration**: Create PostgreSQL schema with appropriate constraints and indexes
3. **Hasura Configuration**: Setup tables, relationships, and permissions in Hasura
4. **Action Handlers**: Implement complex business logic in TypeScript
5. **Testing**: Validate the implementation with unit and integration tests
6. **Documentation**: Document the API, data model, and migration details
