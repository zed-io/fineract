# Fineract to Hasura Migration Roadmap

This document outlines a comprehensive roadmap for converting the remaining Fineract Java modules to the Hasura GraphQL architecture with TypeScript action handlers. The plan is based on successful patterns established in previously migrated modules, particularly the Savings domain which is considered fully complete.

## 1. Current Migration Status

Based on the existing migration progress, the following domains have been fully migrated:
- Client Domain (100%)
- Savings Domain (100%)

Domains with significant progress:
- Loan Domain (75%)
- Group Domain (95%)
- Fixed Deposit Domain (80%) 
- Share Account Domain (90%)
- Recurring Deposit Domain (70%)
- Authentication & Authorization (80%)
- Integration Domain (90%)

## 2. Module Prioritization

The remaining modules will be prioritized for conversion based on:

## 5. Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

### Challenge 1: Complex Business Logic
**Challenge:** Some Fineract modules contain complex business logic, especially in loan calculations and scheduling.

**Mitigation:**
- Break down complex logic into smaller, testable functions
- Use TypeScript's strong typing to prevent errors
- Implement thorough unit testing for business logic
- Consider retaining some Java code as microservices for the most complex algorithms if necessary

### Challenge 2: Data Migration

### Challenge 3: Performance Concerns
**Challenge:** Ensuring the new GraphQL API maintains or improves performance.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Use connection pooling and query optimization
- Implement caching strategies where appropriate
- Conduct performance testing with realistic loads
- Use PostgreSQL-specific optimizations for complex queries

### Challenge 4: Integration Complexity
**Challenge:** Ensuring all modules work together properly.

**Mitigation:**

## 11. Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to completing the migration of Fineract modules from Java to Hasura GraphQL with TypeScript. By following the successful patterns established in the Savings domain, and prioritizing modules based on dependencies and complexity, we can achieve a systematic and complete migration with minimal disruption.

The migration will result in a modern, GraphQL-based API that offers improved developer experience, better frontend integration, and additional flexibility while maintaining the robust business logic that makes Fineract valuable.

## 12. Appendix: Reference Architecture

### Domain Model Structure
```typescript
// Example from Savings Domain
export interface SavingsAccount {
  id: string;
  accountNo: string;
  clientId?: string;
  groupId?: string;
  status: SavingsAccountStatus;
  // ... other properties
}

export enum SavingsAccountStatus {
  SUBMITTED_AND_PENDING_APPROVAL = 'submitted_and_pending_approval',
  APPROVED = 'approved',
  ACTIVE = 'active',
  // ... other statuses
}
```

### Service Layer Pattern
```typescript
// Example service method
export async function depositToSavings(input: DepositTransactionInput, userId: string) {
  return db.transaction(async (client) => {
    // Get account details
    const account = await getSavingsAccountById(client, accountId);
    
    // Validate business rules
    if (account.status !== SavingsAccountStatus.ACTIVE) {
      throw new Error(`Cannot make deposit to account with status ${account.status}`);
    }
    
    // Perform operation
    const transactionId = await createSavingsTransaction(client, {
      // transaction details
    });
    
    // Update related data
    await updateSavingsAccountBalances(client, accountId, {
      // updated balances
    });
    
    // Return result
    return {
      success: true,
      accountId,
      message: 'Deposit processed successfully',
      // other details
    };
  });
}
```

### Handler Pattern
```typescript
// Example handler
router.post('/deposit', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { input, session_variables } = req.body;
    logger.info('Savings deposit request received', { accountId: input.accountId });
    
    const userId = session_variables['x-hasura-user-id'];
    const result = await depositToSavings(input, userId);
    
    res.json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Error processing savings deposit', { error });
    res.status(400).json({
      success: false,
      message: error.message
    });
  }
});
```
