   - Mobile wallet integration points
   - External service connectors (credit bureaus, regulatory reporting)

3. **Business Logic Modules**
   - Member management and onboarding
   - Account management 
   - Loan origination and management
   - Transaction processing
   - Reporting and analytics
   - Compliance and regulatory functions

4. **Scheduled Jobs & Background Processing**
   - Interest calculation and posting
   - Statement generation
   - Batch transaction processing
   - Compliance monitoring
   - Data synchronization

### Frontend Implementation

The frontend consists of two distinct applications:

1. **Staff Portal (Web Application)**
   - Member management interface
   - Account management dashboard
   - Loan origination and approval workflows
   - Transaction processing tools
   - Reporting and analytics dashboard
   - Administration functions

2. **Member-Facing Application (Mobile/Web)**
   - Account overview and management
   - Transaction history and processing
   - Loan application and management
   - Document upload and verification
   - Secure messaging
   - Notifications and alerts

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Architecture

The backend system follows a layered architecture:

1. **Data Layer**
   - PostgreSQL database with properly designed schema
   - Hasura GraphQL Engine for data access and permissions
   - Redis for caching and temporary storage

2. **Service Layer**
   - TypeScript-based microservices for complex business logic
   - Node.js runtime for action handlers and background services
   - Event-driven communication for inter-service communication

3. **API Layer**
   - GraphQL API for frontend communication
   - REST endpoints for legacy system integration
   - Webhooks for real-time event notifications

4. **Integration Layer**
   - Adapters for external system integration
   - Message queues for asynchronous processing
   - API clients for third-party services

### Frontend Architecture

1. **Core Framework**
   - React-based web applications
   - React Native for mobile applications
   - TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience

2. **State Management**
   - Apollo Client for GraphQL data
   - Context API for local state
   - Redux for complex application state (if needed)

3. **UI Components**
   - Shared component library across applications
   - Responsive design principles
   - Accessibility compliance

4. **Security**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - RBAC for authorization
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - HTTPS and proper security headers

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Role-based access controls
   - Personal data anonymization for reporting
   - Secure data deletion processes

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - OAuth2/OpenID Connect integration
   - Fine-grained permissions model
   - Session management and timeout policies

3. **Audit & Compliance**
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - AML/KYC verification workflows
   - Regulatory reporting automation
   - Activity monitoring and alerting

4. **Operational Security**
   - Regular security assessments
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Secure CI/CD pipeline
   - Disaster recovery procedures

## Deployment Considerations

The system supports both cloud-hosted and on-premises deployment models:

### Cloud Deployment
- Containerized services with Kubernetes orchestration
- Database as a Service (DBaaS) for PostgreSQL
- Cloud CDN for static asset delivery
- Managed Redis for caching
- Load balancing and auto-scaling

### On-Premises Deployment
- Virtual machine or bare-metal installation packages
- Local PostgreSQL instance
- Local Redis deployment
- Deployment automation scripts
- Backup and recovery utilities

## Customization for Trinidad and Tobago Requirements

1. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Integration with local credit reporting agencies
   - Compliance with Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago requirements
   - AML/CFT guidelines specific to Trinidad and Tobago
   - Local tax reporting formats

2. **Local Banking Integration**
   - ACH compatibility with Trinidad and Tobago banking system
   - Integration with local payment processors
   - Mobile money integration with local providers
   - Cheque processing based on local formats

3. **Cultural Adaptation**
   - Support for local naming conventions
   - Local address formats
   - Cultural sensitivity in communication templates
   - Language preferences

## Next Steps

1. Set up development infrastructure and environments
2. Configure CI/CD pipeline
3. Conduct detailed technical workshops with credit union stakeholders
4. Begin iterative implementation following the phased approach
5. Establish regular progress reporting and feedback loops
