# Recurring Deposit Beneficiary Management

This document provides an overview of the Recurring Deposit Beneficiary Management feature implemented for Fineract.

## Overview

The Recurring Deposit Beneficiary Management feature allows financial institutions to designate and manage beneficiaries for recurring deposit accounts. Beneficiaries are individuals who are entitled to receive a specified percentage of the deposit amount upon maturity or premature closure. This feature enables proper financial planning and simplifies the distribution of funds in various scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Beneficiary Registration**: Add beneficiaries to recurring deposit accounts with percentage share allocation
- **Verification Process**: Implement a verification workflow for beneficiaries to ensure legitimacy
- **Percentage Validation**: Ensure total beneficiary percentage shares don't exceed 100%
- **Notification System**: Automatically notify beneficiaries of various events (addition, verification, maturity, etc.)
- **Document Management**: Store and manage identity documents and other verification documents
- **Audit Trail**: Track all changes to beneficiary information

## Database Schema

The feature implements the following database schema:

1. **Recurring Deposit Beneficiary Table**: Stores beneficiary information including percentage share, relationship type, and verification status.
2. **Recurring Deposit Beneficiary Notification Table**: Tracks notifications sent to beneficiaries.
3. **Recurring Deposit Beneficiary Notification Preference Table**: Stores communication preferences for beneficiaries.

The schema includes constraints to ensure percentage shares never exceed 100%, verification status tracking, and proper relationship modeling.

## Notification System

The beneficiary notification system leverages the existing notification infrastructure but extends it with recurring deposit-specific templates and logic:

1. **Status Change Notifications**: Automated notifications when beneficiaries are added, verified, or removed
2. **Maturity Notifications**: Notifications to beneficiaries when the deposit is approaching maturity
3. **Premature Closure Notifications**: Alerts to beneficiaries when a deposit is closed prematurely
4. **Custom Notifications**: Ability to send manual notifications to beneficiaries

## GraphQL API

The GraphQL API provides a comprehensive set of operations:

1. **Queries**:
   - `getRecurringDepositBeneficiaries`: List all beneficiaries for an account
   - `getRecurringDepositBeneficiary`: Get details for a specific beneficiary
   - `getRecurringDepositBeneficiaryNotifications`: List notifications for beneficiaries
   - `getRecurringDepositBeneficiaryNotificationPreferences`: Get notification preferences

2. **Mutations**:
   - `addRecurringDepositBeneficiary`: Add a new beneficiary
   - `updateRecurringDepositBeneficiary`: Update an existing beneficiary
   - `verifyRecurringDepositBeneficiary`: Change verification status of a beneficiary
   - `removeRecurringDepositBeneficiary`: Remove a beneficiary
   - `sendRecurringDepositBeneficiaryNotification`: Send a manual notification
   - `updateRecurringDepositBeneficiaryNotificationPreference`: Update notification preferences

## Triggers and Automation

The implementation includes several PostgreSQL triggers and functions:

1. **Percentage Validation**: Ensures total percentage shares don't exceed 100%
2. **Notification Triggers**: Automatically generate notifications on status changes
3. **Maturity Notifications**: Send notifications when deposits approach maturity
4. **Premature Closure Notifications**: Notify beneficiaries when deposits are closed early

## Security and Permissions

The feature implements role-based access control:

- **View Operations**: Available to admin, user, credit_union_admin, credit_union_teller, and credit_union_supervisor roles
- **Management Operations**: Limited to admin, credit_union_admin, and credit_union_supervisor roles

## Integration with Existing Features

This feature integrates with:

1. **Recurring Deposit Accounts**: Direct link to account information
2. **Client Management**: Validation of beneficiary details against client records
3. **Maturity Processing**: Notifications and processing upon deposit maturity
4. **Premature Closure**: Handling of beneficiary shares during premature closure

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to consider:

1. **Automatic Fund Distribution**: Automate the distribution of funds to beneficiaries upon maturity
2. **Enhanced Verification**: Add biometric or multi-factor verification for high-value beneficiaries
3. **Beneficiary Dashboards**: Provide beneficiaries with their own secure access to view expected benefits
4. **Advanced Notification Options**: Additional notification channels and customization
5. **Legal Documentation**: Generate legal documentation for beneficiary assignments

## Implementation Steps

The implementation followed these steps:

1. Database schema creation with appropriate constraints and indexes
2. Notification templates and workflows
3. GraphQL API definition with proper security controls
4. Triggers for automation of key processes
5. Integration with the existing recurring deposit infrastructure

## Testing Considerations

When testing this feature, consider:

1. Percentage allocation validation across multiple beneficiaries
2. Verification workflow for different beneficiary types
3. Notification delivery for various events
4. Performance impact on recurring deposit operations
5. Security and access control validation
