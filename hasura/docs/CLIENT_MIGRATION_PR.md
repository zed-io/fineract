# Client Domain Migration to Hasura - PR Details

## Overview

This PR implements the Client domain migration from Apache Fineract's Java implementation to a Hasura GraphQL API with TypeScript action handlers. This is part of the ongoing effort to modernize the Fineract architecture and provide a more flexible, scalable API.

## Changes

1. **Database Schema**
   - Migrated client domain schema to PostgreSQL in `000003_client_group_schema.up.sql`
   - Added appropriate constraints, indexes, and audit triggers

2. **Hasura Metadata**
   - Added relationship definitions in `client_relationships.json`
   - Created action definitions in `client_actions.yaml`
   - Added GraphQL type definitions in `client_types.graphql`

3. **TypeScript Implementation**
   - Created client API handlers in `handlers/client.ts`
   - Implemented business logic in `services/clientService.ts`
   - Enhanced database utilities to support client operations

4. **Documentation**
   - Created client migration documentation
   - Updated action handlers README
   - Added PR documentation

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:

- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests with the Hasura API
- Manual testing of client workflows:
  - Client creation and updates
  - Client lifecycle operations (activate, close, etc.)
  - Client relationships and identifiers

## Migration Approach

The migration follows these principles:

1. **Data Compatibility**: The PostgreSQL schema is designed to be compatible with the existing Java entity model, allowing for easy data migration.

2. **Business Logic Preservation**: All business validation rules and workflows from the Java implementation are preserved in the TypeScript action handlers.

3. **API Compatibility**: The GraphQL API provides equivalent functionality to the REST API, maintaining backward compatibility where possible.

4. **Performance Optimization**: The implementation leverages PostgreSQL features and Hasura's query capabilities for optimal performance.

## Next Steps

After this PR is merged:

1. Update frontend applications to use the new GraphQL API
2. Migrate test data to validate the implementation
3. Update documentation for API consumers
4. Begin monitoring and performance optimization

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:

1. Revert this PR
2. Return to using the Java implementation 
3. Fix any identified issues in a new branch
4. Re-implement with the fixes
