# Group Domain Testing Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the Group domain in Apache Fineract, covering unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance tests.

## 1. Unit Tests

### Group Domain Model Tests
- `GroupTest`: Test all Group entity methods and business rules
- `GroupRoleTest`: Test GroupRole entity and related functionality
- `GroupLevelTest`: Test GroupLevel entity and hierarchy concepts

### Group Services Tests
- `GroupingTypesWritePlatformServiceTest`: Test group creation, updates, activation, and deletion
- `GroupReadPlatformServiceTest`: Test retrieval of group information
- `GroupRolesWritePlatformServiceTest`: Test group role assignment and management
- `GroupRolesReadPlatformServiceTest`: Test retrieval of group role information

### Group API Tests
- `GroupsApiResourceTest`: Test REST API for groups
- `GroupsLevelApiResourceTest`: Test REST API for group levels

### Validation Tests
- `GroupingTypesDataValidatorTest`: Test validation rules for group operations

## 2. Integration Tests

### Group-Client Relationship Tests
- `GroupClientAssociationTest`: Test associating/disassociating clients with groups
- `GroupClientHierarchyTest`: Test proper hierarchy maintenance with clients

### Group-Group Relationship Tests
- `GroupHierarchyTest`: Test parent-child relationships between groups (centers and groups)
- `GroupCenterRelationshipTest`: Test center-group associations

### Group-Staff Tests
- `GroupStaffAssignmentTest`: Test assigning staff to groups
- `StaffAssignmentHistoryTest`: Test staff assignment history functionality

### Group-Office Tests
- `GroupOfficeRelationshipTest`: Test office assignment and constraints

### Cross-Domain Integration Tests
- `GroupSavingsIntegrationTest`: Test integration between groups and savings
- `GroupLoanIntegrationTest`: Test integration between groups and loans
- `ClientGroupLoanRelationshipsTest`: Test relationships across clients, groups, and loans

## 3. End-to-End Tests

### Group Lifecycle Tests
- `GroupLifecycleE2ETest`: Test complete lifecycle of a group (creation→activation→updates→closure)
- `GroupClientLifecycleE2ETest`: Test client association throughout group lifecycle

### Group Account Tests
- `GroupSavingsE2ETest`: End-to-end tests for group savings accounts
- `GroupLoanE2ETest`: End-to-end tests for group loans
- `GSIMAccountsE2ETest`: Test Group Savings Individual Monitoring (GSIM) accounts

### Group Transfer Tests
- `GroupTransferE2ETest`: Test transferring groups between branches/offices
- `GroupClosureAndTransferE2ETest`: Test closing groups with active accounts/transfers

### Group Hierarchy Operations Tests
- `CenterGroupHierarchyE2ETest`: Test operations across the center-group hierarchy
- `GroupHierarchyMembershipE2ETest`: Test membership changes at different hierarchy levels

## 4. Performance Tests

### Group Operations Performance
- `GroupCreationPerformanceTest`: Test performance of group creation operations
- `GroupSearchPerformanceTest`: Test performance of group search and retrieval
- `GroupUpdatePerformanceTest`: Test performance of group update operations
- `GroupMembershipPerformanceTest`: Test performance of client association/disassociation

### Group Scaling Tests
- `LargeGroupMembershipTest`: Test performance with large numbers of clients in a group
- `LargeGroupHierarchyTest`: Test performance with deep group hierarchies
- `GroupConcurrentAccessTest`: Test concurrent access to group resources

### Group Account Performance Tests
- `GroupSavingsPerformanceTest`: Test performance of savings operations for groups
- `GroupLoanPerformanceTest`: Test performance of loan operations for groups
- `GSIMAccountsPerformanceTest`: Test performance of GSIM accounts with many clients

## 5. API Gateway Tests

### Group API Reliability Tests
- `GroupApiReliabilityTest`: Test reliability of group API endpoints under load
- `GroupApiErrorHandlingTest`: Test proper error handling for group API operations

### Group API Security Tests
- `GroupApiSecurityTest`: Test security aspects of group API endpoints
- `GroupApiAuthorizationTest`: Test proper authorization for group operations

## Integration with Existing Test Framework

All tests should:
1. Extend appropriate base test classes
2. Use common test utilities and helpers
3. Follow established patterns for test data setup and cleanup
4. Be documented with clear test descriptions
5. Be organized in the appropriate test packages
6. Use appropriate test annotations for categorization

## Test Implementation Priority

1. Unit tests for core domain model
2. Basic integration tests for group operations
3. End-to-end tests for critical group flows
4. Performance tests for group operations
5. Complete API gateway tests

## Test Execution Strategy

- Unit tests: Run on every commit
- Integration tests: Run on every PR and nightly
- End-to-end tests: Run on merge to main branch
- Performance tests: Run on scheduled basis (weekly)
