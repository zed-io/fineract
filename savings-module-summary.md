## 2. Current State of the Module

The Savings module has been successfully migrated from Fineract to the Hasura backend with several enhancements. The implementation includes:

- **Database Schema**: Comprehensive PostgreSQL schema for savings products, accounts, transactions, holds, and dormancy management with appropriate constraints and indexes.

- **GraphQL Actions**: Full set of actions to interact with savings functionality through the Hasura GraphQL API.

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Proper permissions for different user roles (admin, staff, members).

- **Business Logic**: Implemented in both database triggers/functions and backend action handlers.

- **Event-Driven Features**: Automatic dormancy transitions, hold expirations, and balance calculations.

The module has been designed with a focus on financial integrity, providing atomic transactions, proper auditing, and secure access controls. It supports both individual and group savings accounts with configurable interest rates and fees.
