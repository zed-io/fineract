## Technical Architecture

### Database Layer
- PostgreSQL 14+ with PostGIS extensions
- Multi-tenant schema design with isolation
- Audit tables for compliance and tracking
- Optimized indexing for common query patterns
- Proper foreign key constraints and data validation

### API Layer
- Hasura GraphQL engine as the primary API gateway
- Custom business logic via Hasura Actions
- Async processing with Event Triggers
- REST endpoints via Hasura REST endpoints
- WebSockets for real-time updates

### Authentication & Security
- JWT-based authentication with RS256 signing

- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing

### Scalability & Reliability
- Horizontal scaling of API nodes
- Database connection pooling
- Read replicas for reporting workloads
- Automated failover capabilities
- Regular backup and disaster recovery testing

## GraphQL API Schema Design

The GraphQL API is designed with the following principles:

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: APIs reflect credit union business domains
2. **Consistent Naming**: Clear, consistent naming conventions
3. **Proper Typing**: Strong type definitions with input validation
4. **Role-Based Access**: Permissions defined at the field level
5. **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses and codes

### Primary GraphQL Types
- Member management and KYC
- Account operations and management
- Transaction processing and history
- Loan origination and servicing
- Document management and versioning
- Reporting and analytics
- Administration and configuration

### Custom Business Logic
- Loan calculation engines
- Interest accrual processing
- KYC verification workflows
- AML transaction monitoring
- Regulatory reporting generation

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- PII data encryption at rest and in transit
- Data masking for sensitive information
- Secure document storage and access
- Retention policies for compliance requirements

### Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Biometric authentication support
- Session management and token expiration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Audit & Compliance
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Tamper-evident transaction history
- Non-repudiation for critical actions
- CBTT regulatory compliance

## Deployment & DevOps

### CI/CD Pipeline
