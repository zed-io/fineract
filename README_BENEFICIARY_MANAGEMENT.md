# Savings Account Beneficiary Management Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds full beneficiary management functionality to savings accounts in Fineract. Beneficiaries are individuals who are designated to receive funds from a savings account in case of the account holder's death or other specified conditions.

## Features Implemented

1. **Database Schema**
   - Created a dedicated `savings_account_beneficiary` table with comprehensive attributes
   - Added constraints to ensure data integrity
   - Implemented triggers for percentage validation and audit trails

2. **GraphQL API**
   - Added GraphQL types for beneficiary operations
   - Implemented mutations for adding, updating, and removing beneficiaries
   - Developed queries for listing beneficiaries

3. **Business Logic**
   - Implemented percentage allocation validation to ensure totals don't exceed 100%
   - Added account status validation
   - Implemented soft-delete functionality for beneficiaries

4. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation in `/hasura/docs/BENEFICIARY_MANAGEMENT.md`
   - Added test scripts for validating functionality
