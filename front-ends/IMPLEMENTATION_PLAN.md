# Front-End Implementation Plan

This document outlines the strategy for completely transitioning from the Angular-based web-app to the Next.js-based credit-cloud-admin front-end.

## Goals

1. Create a modern, intuitive, and responsive UI
2. Leverage the Hasura GraphQL API for efficient data access
3. Eliminate the Angular implementation completely
4. Ensure feature parity with existing functionality
5. Add new features that enhance user experience

## Strategy Overview

We'll adopt a feature-based migration approach, implementing complete features in Next.js rather than migrating screens one by one. This allows us to:

- Provide immediate value to users
- Test complete user flows in the new stack
- Avoid maintaining two different implementations of the same feature

## Completed Features

- ✅ Authentication system (Firebase/JWT)
- ✅ Basic dashboard structure
- ✅ Client/savings account summary views
- ✅ Beneficiary management for savings accounts
- ✅ Savings account transaction management
  - ✅ Transaction history and filtering
  - ✅ Deposit and withdrawal functionality
  - ✅ Transaction reversal capability
  - ✅ Visual transaction categorization

## Phase 1: Savings Management (2-3 Weeks)

Building upon the beneficiary management component, we'll complete the savings management experience:

### 1. Savings Account Dashboard (Completed)
- ✅ Enhanced account details view with summary information
- ✅ Transaction history with filtering and pagination
- ✅ Complete savings account list view with filters and search
- ✅ Account status management and workflow

### 2. Savings Account Operations (In Progress)
- ✅ Deposit and withdrawal functionality
- ✅ Transaction management and reversal
- ⬜ Interest calculation and posting
- ⬜ Statement generation and export

### 3. Beneficiary Feature Enhancements (In Progress)
- ✅ Implement percentage share visualization with pie chart
- ⬜ Add document upload for beneficiaries
- ⬜ Add beneficiary verification workflow
- ⬜ Implement beneficiary notification system

### 4. Joint Account Management
- Implement joint holder UI components
- Create joint holder management workflow
- Integrate with beneficiary management

## Phase 2: Client Management (2-3 Weeks)

With savings management complete, we'll focus on a complete client management experience:

### 1. Client Dashboard
- Client listing with search and advanced filters
- Client profile with comprehensive details
- KYC document management

### 2. Client Creation and Onboarding
- Multi-step client creation workflow
- Document upload and verification
- Approval workflows

### 3. Client Services Integration
- Integrating savings accounts with client profiles
- Client activity timeline
- Notifications and alert management

## Phase 3: Loan Management (3-4 Weeks)

After clients and savings, we'll implement loan management features:

### 1. Loan Product Management
- Loan product configuration
- Interest rate management
- Fee structure setup

### 2. Loan Application Process
- Application forms with validation
- Credit scoring integration
- Approval workflow

### 3. Loan Account Management
- Disbursement process
- Repayment scheduling
- Loan closure and write-off processes

## Phase 4: Accounting & Reporting (2-3 Weeks)

Finally, we'll implement accounting and reporting features:

### 1. General Ledger
- Chart of accounts management
- Journal entries and posting
- Account reconciliation

### 2. Financial Reporting
- Balance sheet and income statement
- Portfolio reports
- Regulatory compliance reports

### 3. Operational Reports
- User activity reports
- Performance dashboards
- Data exports and integrations

## Technical Improvements

Throughout each phase, we'll also focus on:

### 1. Component Library Enhancement
- Create reusable patterns for common UI elements
- Implement consistent loading/error states
- Build shared form validation patterns

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Implement query caching with Apollo Client
- Add client-side data validation
- Optimize bulk operations with batched mutations

### 3. Testing & Documentation
- Create comprehensive test coverage
- Document component usage patterns
- Build user documentation for new features

## Implementation Approach

For each feature, we will follow this process:

1. **Analysis**: Understand existing implementation and user needs
2. **Design**: Create component designs and data flow diagrams
3. **Implementation**: Build React components with TypeScript
4. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
5. **Documentation**: Update technical and user documentation
6. **Deployment**: Deploy to staging for feedback
7. **Refinement**: Address feedback and optimize

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining Savings Account Operations features
   - Implement interest calculation and posting
   - Build statement generation and export functionality
2. Finish Beneficiary Management enhancements
   - Add document upload for beneficiaries
   - Implement verification workflow and notification system
3. Begin work on Joint Account Management
4. Start Client Management components implementation
5. Create a timeline for Angular retirement

This phased approach ensures we deliver value continuously while progressively replacing the Angular implementation with a modern React-based solution.
