/**
 * Defines the method of leap year calculation for determining the number of days in a year.
 * <p>
 * This enum has two modes:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #FULL_LEAP_YEAR} - Always considers 366 days in a leap year.</li>
 * <li>{@link #FEB_29_PERIOD_ONLY} - Considers 366 days only if the period includes February 29th; otherwise, uses 365
 * days.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * When using {@link DaysInYearType#ACTUAL}, the {@code FEB_29_PERIOD_ONLY} rule applies:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the period includes February 29th, the calculation considers 366 days.</li>
 * <li>Otherwise, even if the year is a leap year, the calculation uses 365 days.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Examples:</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>366 Days:</b> A period from February 10th to March 10th in a leap year will consider 366 days, since February
 * 29th is within the period.</li>
 * <li><b>365 Days:</b> A period from March 10th to April 10th in a leap year will consider 365 days, as February 29th
 * is not within the period.</li>
 * </ul>
