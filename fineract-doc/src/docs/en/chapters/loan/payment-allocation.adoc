== Payment Allocation Strategies

=== Overview

Payment allocation strategies determine how loan repayments are applied to different components of the loan:

* Principal
* Interest
* Fees
* Penalties

Fineract supports multiple built-in allocation strategies and also allows for custom strategies to be implemented.

=== Default Allocation Strategies

Fineract provides several default allocation strategies:

1. *Penalties, Fees, Interest, Principal order* - The standard strategy that applies payments first to penalties, then fees, then interest, and finally principal.

2. *Interest, Principal, Penalties, Fees order* - Prioritizes interest and principal payments before penalties and fees.

3. *Principal, Interest, Penalties, Fees order* - Prioritizes principal repayment first, followed by interest, penalties, and fees.

4. *Early Payment Strategy* - Special handling for early repayments.

5. *RBI (India) Strategy* - Follows regulatory requirements for the Reserve Bank of India.

=== Flexible Payment Allocation Strategy

The Flexible Payment Allocation Strategy is an enhanced strategy that provides configurable allocation rules:

==== Features

* *Custom allocation order* - Configure the order in which payments are applied to different components.
* *Overpayment handling* - Configure how excess payments are handled (applied to future installments or treated as advance payments).
* *Installment processing order* - Process installments in chronological order or based on specific rules.
* *Partial payments* - Proper handling of partial payments based on the configured allocation order.

==== Configuration

The Flexible Payment Allocation Strategy can be configured with the following parameters:

1. *allocationOrder* - The order in which to apply payments to components (PENALTY, FEE, INTEREST, PRINCIPAL).
2. *applyExcessToNextInstallment* - Whether to apply excess payments to future installments.
3. *applyPaymentInChronologicalOrder* - Whether to process installments in chronological order.
4. *treatOverpaymentAsAdvancePayment* - Whether to treat overpayments as advance payments.

==== Example Configurations

===== Principal First (Reducing Balance Method)

This configuration prioritizes principal repayment to reduce the overall interest on the loan:

[source,java]
----
List<PaymentAllocationOrder> principalFirstOrder = Arrays.asList(
    PaymentAllocationOrder.PRINCIPAL,
    PaymentAllocationOrder.INTEREST,
    PaymentAllocationOrder.FEE,
    PaymentAllocationOrder.PENALTY
);
----

===== Interest First (Flat Interest Method)

This configuration ensures interest is paid first:

[source,java]
----
List<PaymentAllocationOrder> interestFirstOrder = Arrays.asList(
    PaymentAllocationOrder.INTEREST,
    PaymentAllocationOrder.PRINCIPAL,
    PaymentAllocationOrder.FEE,
    PaymentAllocationOrder.PENALTY
);
----

=== Implementation

To use the Flexible Payment Allocation Strategy in loan products:

1. Enable the strategy in your Spring configuration
2. Configure the allocation rules as needed
3. Set the loan product's transaction processing strategy to "flexible-allocation-strategy"

=== Advanced Payment Scenarios

The Flexible Payment Allocation Strategy properly handles:

* *Partial payments* - Applied according to the defined allocation order
* *Overpayments* - Can be applied to future installments or treated as advance payments
* *Late payments* - Processed according to the configured allocation rules
* *Refunds* - Applied in reverse order of the allocation strategy
* *Multiple installment payments* - Excess can cascade to future installments

=== Custom Strategies

For even more customized behavior, you can implement your own allocation strategy by:

1. Extending `AbstractLoanRepaymentScheduleTransactionProcessor`
2. Implementing the required methods
3. Creating a condition class to determine when to use the strategy
4. Registering your strategy in the Spring configuration
